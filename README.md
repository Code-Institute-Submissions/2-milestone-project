## UX
 
  The App consists in a `dashboard` page where useres can input author and repository in order to find

  very user friendly, once found the repo can be clicked directing the user to another page.
  
  The page `repository` lists all issues in the repository found clicking in them the user will
  bne dfirect to tha issues page, the page displays the number of forks, stars and issues in repo.
  
  Both pages displays Repository description, and profile.
  
  all the app is made thinking about the user experience, easy navigation, harmony colors and design,
  the app is following the best pratices in design software aiming, code maintenance, growth and better reading.

## libraries
<pre>
* Typescrit:  it's a superset tool to type javascript typing your elements
in the app you can easy indentify the properties elements specially when the application is
getting big, it allows you to create interfaces to type your components with the params
that you want inside the components and much more... behind the scenes it compiles
your code in pure javascript wich will make sure it's gonna run in other browsers.
https://www.typescriptlang.org/

* Styled Components:  it's a CSS library that allow us to wrap all CSS styles in
a `var` that can be exported to our HTML pages as a react component. Syntax EX:


import styled from 'styled-components';                  import React from 'react';
                                                         
export const Container = styled.div`         **=>**      import { Container } from '../../_styles_css/explore/styles';
  p {                                                    
    font-weight: bold;                                   const HelloWorld: React.FC = () => {
    }                                                     return (
`;                                                          <Container>
                                                              **ReactJs**
                                                            </Container>
                                                           );
                                                         };
                                                         
                                                         export default HelloWorld;

For each element wrapped inside <Container> which is already an HTML tag in this case a `div` 
styled components already creates a unique class wich makes it way easy to work on, isolating 
the elements that you wanna apply styles.

* Polished: Polished is a mini library that allows the easy implementation of javascript code 
in css like conditionals, easy hovers, get html params etc... example syntax:

const styles = {
  color: '#333',
  "font-size": '1.33em',
  '@media only screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), only screen and (min--moz-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5),
  only screen and (-o-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5/1), only screen and (min-resolution: 144dpi),
  only screen and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)': {
    "font-size": '1.66625em',
  }
  https://polished.js.org/
  
* Jest:  it's a testing library that helps you to write tests in your application in a fast and
easy way.
https://jestjs.io/
</pre>
   
## Testing
    
    Usability Testing.
    **Verify the app cability of add repository when called using jest**
    1. Go in the project folder `Exploring-git` and run: `yarn test` or `npm test` in your terminal.
      
    ‚àö should be able to add repo.
    
    It verifies when the input is filled and you pres the Search button,
    repository exists after the click.
    https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro
   <pre>
   
   Functionality Testing.
   Route Links in the app are mocked and manually tested you can free navigate in the application.
   
   The only link in the app to an external page is working perfectly and target blank.
  
   Compatibility Testing.
   I tested the app manually on a variaty of browsers:
   
   Chrome
   Brave
   Edge
   FireFox
   
   and mobile:
   
   Iphone 10
   Sansung Galaxy S7
   
   Performance Testing.
   and different screen sizes using the inspector.
   criteria: responsivity, fluidity, design, sizes functionality behavior.
   
Form:
JavaScript validation     
If validation ensure if the value in the input is valid
or null and returns an error message in the frontend and backend.

ESlint: Tool that verify automatcally your JS code, preventing,
fixing and reporting syntax errors, integrated with prettier
will ensure a beautifull and good style guid for better reading  
preventing errors.
To verify the rules and settings apllied in the project go on: 
exploring-git `route directory`
/eslintrc.json
/prettier.config.js

https://eslint.org/
https://prettier.io/

  The app is very beautiful, the colors, 
  animations and effects it looks very professional.
  I wish I were able to build those web applications
  too.

  I'm a develope too and it's impressed my brother's 
  code quality. the app itself it's very good, fluid, beaultiful
  and simple and it works well for the purpose.
  He is always teaching me different ways to make 
  things easier, it's great that there is always new 
  technologies and the new generations are interested
  in it.
